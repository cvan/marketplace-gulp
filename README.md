marketplace-gulp
================

gulpfiles for Firefox Marketplace frontend projects.

These gulpfiles includes tasks for JS, CSS, and template builds.

To develop on marketplace-gulp, I'd recommend cloning this project directly
into the ```bower_components``` directory of your Firefox Marketplace
frontend project.
